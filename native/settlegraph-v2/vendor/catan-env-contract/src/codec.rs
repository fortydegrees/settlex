//! Fixed discrete action space for RL: every action a policy could ever
//! take has one id in 0..NUM_ACTIONS, valid for the lifetime of a trained
//! network.
//!
//! Design rules:
//! - Ids encode WHAT and WHERE, never WHO: the actor is always the player
//!   the engine says must act (`game.current_player()`).
//! - Seat references (steal victims, trade partners) are RELATIVE to the
//!   actor (+1, +2, +3 around the table) so one policy generalizes across
//!   seats.
//! - Phase-exclusive actions share ids: "place a settlement at vertex v" is
//!   one id whether it's the setup draft or the main phase; "place a road
//!   at edge e" covers setup roads, paid roads, and Road Building card
//!   placements. They can never coexist, and collapsing them keeps the
//!   space tight.
//!
//! Layout (start offset, count):
//!   settlement at vertex      0   54
//!   city at vertex           54   54
//!   road at edge            108   72
//!   robber to tile          180   19
//!   steal rel seat 1-3      199    3
//!   steal skip (nobody)     202    1
//!   discard resource        203    5
//!   monopoly resource       208    5
//!   year of plenty pair     213   15   (r1 <= r2)
//!   bank trade give/recv    228   20   (give != recv)
//!   propose give/amt/recv   248   40   (amount 1-2, give != recv)
//!   respond accept/reject   288    2
//!   confirm rel partner 1-3 290    3
//!   confirm cancel          293    1
//!   roll dice               294    1
//!   buy dev card            295    1
//!   play knight             296    1
