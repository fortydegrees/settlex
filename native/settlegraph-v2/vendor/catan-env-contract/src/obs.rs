//! Observation encoder: a fixed-length f32 vector view of the game from one
//! seat's perspective — the policy network's input.
//!
//! Design rules (mirrors of the codec's):
//! - Fixed layout, frozen once training starts: slot i always means the
//!   same thing. `OBS_VERSION` is stored in checkpoints and must match.
//! - Seat-relative: players appear in the order me, +1, +2, +3 around the
//!   table, so one network generalizes across seats.
//! - Categorical data is one-hot (a network must not read resource id 3 as
//!   "more than" id 2); scalars are normalized to roughly [0, 1]; dice
//!   numbers are encoded as production PROBABILITY, not face value.
//! - Two visibility modes with the same shape: `Perfect` shows opponents'
//!   hands and dev cards; `Realistic` zeroes exactly that block (counts
//!   stay visible — they're public in real Catan).
//!
//! Layout (start offset, count):
//!   tiles        19 x 8   [resource one-hot(6) | production prob | robber]
//!   vertices     54 x 14  [building by rel seat: (settle, city) x4 | port one-hot(6)]
//!   edges        72 x 4   [road owner rel one-hot]
//!   players       4 x 17  public per rel seat (see PLAYER_* consts)
//!   self private      15  [hand(5) | dev by type(5) | bought this turn(5)]
//!   opp private   3 x 10  [hand(5) | dev by type(5)] — zeroed in Realistic
//!   bank               5
//!   context           20  [game phase(4) | turn phase(9) | dice | rolled |
//!                          turn | victory target | roads to place |
//!                          trades left | my discards due]
//!   trade offer       16  [present | proposer rel(4) | give(5) | amount | recv(5)]
