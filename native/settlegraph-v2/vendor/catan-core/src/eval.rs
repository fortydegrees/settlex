//! Position evaluation ("how good is this game state for player p?") and a
//! 1-ply greedy lookahead player built on it.
//!
//! Unlike `HeuristicPlayer` (which scores *actions* with local rules) this
//! scores *states*: the bot simulates every legal action on a cloned game and
//! picks the one whose resulting position evaluates best. True minimax does
//! not apply to 4-player stochastic Catan, so opponent awareness lives inside
//! the evaluation instead: the searched objective is
//! `V(me) - opp_lambda * max V(opponent)`, which makes robber placement,
//! blocking and discard choices fall out of one function.
//!
//! All weights are collected in `ValueParams` with to/from_array so the GA in
//! catan-sim can evolve them exactly like `HeuristicParams`.
