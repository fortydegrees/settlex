# PROGRESS

## Status (2026-01-08)
- Phase 0: added AI harness files (`AGENTS.md`, `game-core/AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent/*`).
- Phase 1: created pnpm workspace + `game-core` scaffold, added Vitest config, and moved core types/spec/board generation into `game-core`.
- Fixed Next import/export issue for `@settlex/game-core`, removed duplicate `PlayerColor` export, and updated board generation RNG to use boardgame.io `random.Number()`; `/catana` now renders.
- Added deterministic RNG helper and board-generation invariant tests in `game-core`.
- Added core topology/state scaffolding and buildability rule tests (setup + normal placement).
- Migrated placement moves to core `GameState`.
- Updated `Board.js` to render settlements/roads/actions from core state via render maps (no `G.nodes`/`G.edges`).
- Added trading rules to `game-core` (maritime + player trades), including port eligibility and trade-rate enforcement.
- Added victory/awards helpers in `game-core` (Longest Road, Largest Army, VP calculation) with tests and recompute hooks.
- Added ruleset specs/factory and minimal validation enforced in `createEmptyState`.
- Added a board preset resolver (`standard-random`) and switched UI setup to use random board generation with a stored `boardPresetId`.
- Migrated UI to read from `G.core` (player views, roads/settlements, build actions) and routed moves through core rules for a minimal playable loop.

## Next
- Expand `game-core` tests beyond buildability (robber, resource distribution, longest road).
- Clean up legacy duplicates in `app/catana/game`, `spec/`, `strategy/`, `utils/`.
- Address React list key warnings in `app/catana/Board.js`.

## Notes
- Keep Next as the UI shell; multiplayer runs in the separate boardgame.io server.

## Status (2026-01-09)
- Added failing applyEndTurn test coverage in `game-core/src/rules/turnFlow.test.ts` to drive end-turn behavior.
